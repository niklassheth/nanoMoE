## Done:
- Load tinystories
- Use the new dataloader

## Very Soon:
- Train a new tokenizer

## Soon:
- Prevent cross doc attn (needs dataloader partial rewrite)

## Maybe:
- Add more features from deepseek:
  - Shared expert (plus fine grained MoE)
  - FP8
  - MLA
  - No aux loss load balance (might be too hard)
